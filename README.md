Java GUI to control an Arduino

This set of code will allow you to control an Arduino Uno through a Java GUI.  You will need some experience with coding Java programs and also coding Arduino Uno systems.  It is fairly straightforward.  I used Eclipse as my IDE and if your Arduino is using COM3 on your computer you should be able to just compile the program to start the GUI.
